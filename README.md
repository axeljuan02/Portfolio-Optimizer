# SORA ‚Äî The Smart Optimized Risk Allocator

**SORA** is the fastest evolving project at the crossroads of **quantitative finance**, **programming**, and **investment education**.  

It began as a deep dive into the **world of institutional investing**, a way to understand how real portfolios are built, how risk is managed, and how professional models work in practice.  

Its ambition quickly grew: to build a **professional-grade portfolio optimization engine** that is **powerful, transparent, and accessible**, turning the complex theories and tools of Wall Street into something **anyone** can learn from and use.  

> *‚ÄúDemocratizing intelligent and professional investing for everyone, because no, investment isn't that easy.‚Äù*

SORA isn‚Äôt just an optimizer. It‚Äôs a mission to **educate as much as it optimizes**, revealing the models used by institutions, breaking down the knowledge gap, and empowering individual investors to make **truly informed decisions**.



## üìå A Mission

When I began this project, my first goal was simple: to truly understand how **institutional and professional investing** works, the **real investment world** beyond what‚Äôs marketed to individuals.  

I wanted to revisit and apply the **finance concepts I studied at ESSEC**, not just to test them, but to **professionalize my own investments**.  

As I explored deeper, diving into the theories and models used by today‚Äôs financial giants, I saw the **massive knowledge gap** between institutions and everyday investors. It became clear how many modern investment platforms and ‚Äúfinance influencers‚Äù were selling the illusion of *simple, accessible investing for everyone*.  

But the truth is: it‚Äôs not that simple.  

This project was born from a belief that **everyone deserves access to elite knowledge and tools**, that the models once reserved for institutional desks could be **demystified and made usable**.  

And that‚Äôs when SORA stopped being just a coding experiment, and started its transformation into a project with a mission:  
‚Üí **To close the gap. To democratize professional investing.**



## ‚ö†Ô∏è About This Repository

This public repository **SORA Core Engine**, showcases the full **Python-based foundation** of the SORA project: a modular portfolio optimizer with quantitative models like **Markowitz**, **Monte Carlo simulation**, **Fama-French 5 factors**, and a first integration of **AI/NLP logic**.  
It is made publicly available for **educational, technical, and demonstrative purposes**, particularly for academic admissions, recruiters, and fellow developers.

In parallel, a **private repository** **SORA WebApp Premium** is under development. It includes all the elements necessary to turn this engine into a full SaaS product:  
A production-ready **Django backend**, a **React frontend**, advanced **AI features**, and a **macroeconomic intelligence module**.

While this public repo demonstrates the **core engine built from scratch**, not all features are showcased here, and thus by design. Some modules remain private to preserve both a **technical and strategic edge** as part of SORA‚Äôs SaaS development.  
This repo is primarily meant to **showcase coding skills and quantitative expertise** for **academic admissions** and **professional opportunities**.  



## ‚úÖ Current Features

- **Multi-Strategy Optimizer**  
3 core strategies: **Max Sharpe ratio**, **Max Expected Return**, **Min Volatility**  
KPIs: Sharpe, Beta, Volatility, Expected Return  
Portfolio constraints: no short-selling, capped allocation per asset  

- **Harry Markowitz's Efficient Frontier Generator**  
Simulation of thousands of portfolios   
Visualization of the **risk/return trade-off**    
Highlighting the optimal portfolio allocations vs the actual portfolio allocations

- **Monte Carlo Risk Engine**  
**VaR** (Value at Risk) and **CVaR** (Conditional VaR) computed through **Monte Carlo simulation**  
Loss distribution plots and extreme risk scenarios  

- **Fama-French 5 Factor Model Integration**  
Regression of the portfolio‚Äôs **excess returns** on the five Fama-French factors  
Extraction of **alpha** (manager skill) and **betas** (factor exposures)  
Bar chart visualization of factor loadings with **R¬≤** and **Adjusted R¬≤** annotations

- **AI/NLP Assistant Integration**  
OpenAI-powered assistant connected to the full model output.  
Generates context-aware summaries and answers in real-time, directly in the terminal.  
Includes intelligent memory, full chart/data access, and **color-coded chat interface** for clarity.  


## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1Ô∏è‚É£ **User inputs**: portfolio tickers & allocations  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Market data** is fetched via Yahoo Finance  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Metrics calculated**: returns, volatility, Sharpe, Beta, etc.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Optimization runs**: chosen strategy (Sharpe, min-vol, etc.)  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Risk engine**: Monte Carlo simulation runs ‚Üí VaR & CVaR calculated  
6Ô∏è‚É£ **Factor model**: Fama-French 5 regression ‚Üí alpha & beta extraction  
7Ô∏è‚É£ **AI assistant activated**: parses all results (charts, KPIs, regressions) and answers user queries via intelligent memory  
8Ô∏è‚É£ **Outputs delivered**: optimized weights, full analytics, risk plots, and interactive AI reports in terminal
