# SORA WebApp for SaaS Development

**SORA WebApp Premium** is the private SaaS extension of the SORA Core Engine: a full-stack investment intelligence platform that brings institutional-grade analytics, macroeconomic insight, and AI-powered decision support to individual investors.

This repository represents the productization phase of SORA: transitioning from a technical prototype to a production-ready, scalable platform, while staying true to its mission of financial knowledge democratization.

> “From code to product. From learning to leverage.”


## 🎯 Strategic Positioning

SORA began as an academic and technical exploration of quantitative finance. It is now evolving into a next-generation **investor productivity suite**, combining robust financial modeling, interactive data visualization, and conversational AI.

While the mission remains to **close the knowledge gap in investing**, this private instance enables the development of defensible IP, refined user experience, and advanced system integrations.

This private repository reflects thus a dual-track strategy:

- A [public repository](https://github.com/axeljuan02/SORA-Core-Engine) demonstrates coding capabilities, algorithmic logic, and core financial models for academic and professional outreach.  
- This private version focuses on deployability, UI/UX, and proprietary feature development intended for commercialization.
